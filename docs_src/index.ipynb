    "The fastai library simplifies training fast and accurate neural nets using modern best practices. It's based on research in to deep learning best practices undertaken at [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai), including \"out of the box\" support for [`vision`](/vision#vision), [`text`](/text#text), [`tabular`](/tabular#tabular), and [`collab`](/collab#collab) (collaborative filtering) models. If you're looking for the source code, head over to the [fastai repo](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) on GitHub. For brief examples, see the [examples](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/tree/master/examples) folder; detailed examples are provided in the full documentation (see the sidebar). For example, here's how to train an MNIST model using [resnet18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) (from the [vision example](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/examples/vision.ipynb)):"

    "At the base of everything are the two modules [`core`](/core#core) and [`torch_core`](/torch_core#torch_core) (we're not including the `fastai.` prefix when naming modules in these docs). They define the basic functions we use in the library; [`core`](/core#core) only relies on general modules, whereas [`torch_core`](/torch_core#torch_core) requires pytorch. Most type-hinting shortcuts are defined there too (at least the one that don't depend on fastai classes defined later). Nearly all modules below import [`torch_core`](/torch_core#torch_core).\n",

    "- [`layers`](/layers#layers), which contains basic functions to define custom layers or groups of layers\n",
    "- [`metrics`](/metrics#metrics), which contains all the metrics\n",
    "\n",

Those are functions that will be called every step of the way of the training loop and can allow us to customize what is happening there;\n",
    "- [`basic_train`](/basic_train#basic_train) (depends on [`callback`](/callback#callback)) defines [`Learner`](/basic_train#Learner) and [`Recorder`](/basic_train#Recorder) (which is a callback that records training stats) and has the training loop;\n",
    "- [`callbacks`](/callbacks#callbacks) (depends on [`basic_train`](/basic_train#basic_train)) is a submodule defining various callbacks, such as for mixed precision training or 1cycle annealing;\n",
    "- `learn` (depends on [`callbacks`](/callbacks#callbacks)) defines helper functions to invoke the callbacks more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "From [`data`](/vision.data#vision.data) we can split on one of the four main *applications*, which each has their own module: [`vision`](/vision#vision), [`text`](/text#text) [`collab`](/collab#collab), or [`tabular`](/tabular#tabular).
